## Klassy
[_Klassy_](https://github.com/paulmcauley/klassy) (formerly _ClassiK_/_ClassikStyles_) is a highly customizable binary Window Decoration, Application Style and Global Theme plugin for recent versions of the KDE Plasma desktop. Initially taking inspiration from the iconography of KDE 1, the _Klassy_ defaults are an attempt to create a usable and appealing look for the modern Plasma desktop.
